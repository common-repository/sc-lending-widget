SmartCredit.io Lending Widget allows the lender to lend money fixed-term and to earn recurring income. 

== Description ==
 
The lender can define the maturity rules, i.e., into which maturities he would like to invest. For example, the lender can invest in short-term maturities (less annual interest) or longer-term maturities (more annual interest).

The lender needs to:
* Connect via metamask to his Ethereum address
* Define the maturity rules
* Deposit the funds

The lender can manage his investments via the Lending Widget or the https://smartcredit.io (via connecting the same Ethereum address)
